>>> from project.myapp.tasks import mytask   # << GOOD

>>> from myapp.tasks import mytask    # << BAD!!!
The second example will cause the task to be named differently since the worker and the client imports the modules under different names:

>>> from project.myapp.tasks import mytask
>>> mytask.name
'project.myapp.tasks.mytask'

>>> from myapp.tasks import mytask
>>> mytask.name
'myapp.tasks.mytask'
So for this reason you must be consistent in how you import modules, which is also a Python best practice.

Similarly, you should not use old-style relative imports:

from module import foo   # BAD!

from proj.module import foo  # GOOD!
New-style relative imports are fine and can be used:

from .module import foo  # GOOD!
